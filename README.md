```

### DESCRIPTION
This application is a study about the Cellular Automata.
The main goal is to visualize the evolution of the automata in a 2D grid.
It allow to change the rules of the automata and the size of the grid and it is possible to visualize some statistics about the evolution of the automata.

### USAGE
```bash
python main.py
```
